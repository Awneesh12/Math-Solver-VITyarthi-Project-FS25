MATH SOLVER SYSTEM

--- Project Title ---

Math Solver (Python Console Application)

The Math Solver System is a comprehensive, menu-driven Python program designed to act as an "all-in-one" computational tool. It centralizes a wide range of Mathematical Operations, from Basic Calculations to Complex Matrix and Statistical Analysis into a single, easy-to-use console interface.

This program supports 9 types of Math Problems -
- Basic Calculation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Exponential)
- Quadratic Equation Solver
- Two Linear Equation with Two Variables Solver
- LCM and HCF Calculation
- Prime Number Verifier and Prime Factor Calculator
- Statistical Calculations (Mean, Median, Mode)
- Area and Perimeter Calculator (Square, Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Parallelogram)
- Factorial Calculator
- Matrix Operations (Addition, Multiplication, and Inverse)
